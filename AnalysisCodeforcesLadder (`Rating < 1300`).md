### ✅ **Difficulty Breakdown:**

| Codeforces Difficulty | Count | Approx. LeetCode Equivalent                       | LeetCode Level                 |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1                     | 29    | Easy (Brute-force, Strings, Greedy)               | Easy (\~50–200 solved)         |
| 2                     | 29    | Easy to Medium (Ad-hoc, Greedy, Sorting)          | Easy-Medium (\~200–400 solved) |
| 3                     | 36    | Medium (Greedy, Math, Prefix Sums, 2-pointer)     | Medium (\~400–600 solved)      |
| 4                     | 6     | Medium-Hard (Prefix Sums, Constructive, DP start) | Medium-Hard (\~600+ solved)    |

### 📊 **Total Counts:**

* Difficulty 1 → ✅ **29 problems**
* Difficulty 2 → ✅ **29 problems**
* Difficulty 3 → ✅ **36 problems**
* Difficulty 4 → ✅ **6 problems**

### 🔁 **Comparison with LeetCode Difficulty:**

| Codeforces Rating | LeetCode Tag | Explanation                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rating 1          | Easy         | Mostly string handling, brute-force, math                                         |
| Rating 2          | Easy–Medium  | Requires logic + basic implementation (simulation, greedy)                        |
| Rating 3          | Medium       | Greedy + prefix sums + edge handling, similar to **LC 2-pointer/sliding window**  |
| Rating 4          | Medium–Hard  | Some DP, constructive, frequency analysis like **LC hard easies or easy mediums** |

---

### ✅ Summary:

This ladder is great for:

* Practicing **fundamentals + edge cases**.
* **Bridging Easy to Medium LeetCode**.
* Training your **greedy/math/observation** skills.

### 📌 Suggestion:

If you're solving this ladder alongside LeetCode:

* **Start with Difficulty 1–2** → Solve in bulk (easy practice)
* **Spend time on Difficulty 3** → Improves your **problem solving depth**
* **Difficulty 4** → Try after **500+ LeetCode** for confidence.
